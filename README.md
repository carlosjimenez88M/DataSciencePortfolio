# Data Science Portfolio

In this repository you can find a collection of selected data science projects (and products) that I developed throughout my career.

## Contents 

* [Machine Learning](https://github.com/carlosjimenez88M/DataScicencePortfolio/tree/master/Machine_Learning): This folder is a collections on differents Machine Learning and Data Engineering techiques for differents data challenges, with special focus in : time series applications, deep learning architectures, and NLP Finetuning

* [NLP Dashboard](https://danieljimenez.shinyapps.io/salvador/): This Dashboard combines two lenguages (R and Python), and aimed are : 

|**Goal**|**Technology**|
|----:|----------:|
|Text Classification|Python (Transformers and BERT)|
|Model: Questions and Answering |Python (NLP and Deep learning features)|
|Text Mining and EDA|R (tidytext and Topic Modeling)|
|Dynamic Data Tables|SQL and Javascript|
|Web Scraping|R (rvest and Rcurl)|

* **Interpretability Machine Learning** : The Machine Learning applications with impact on everydays for decision-making with consistency (reasons) and coherence (depending on the problem), in this example is a prediction case : [MILE](https://www.danieljimenezm.com/post/2020-07-18-models_interpretability/)

* **Data Analytics and Visualization** : Examples on data visualization, analysis and  analytics projects: [Tidytuesday](https://github.com/carlosjimenez88M/Tidy-tuesday)

* __Bayesian Machine Learning presentation:__ Examples and explained Bayesian Machine Learning techniques, you can see this presentation, documentation and practical example making click [**here**](https://github.com/carlosjimenez88M/Bayes_presentation)

## In progress

* Computational Vision with dockerized application 

* API Apple Watch application : Utilizing my personal data from  exercises (bike) tracker to perform an analysis of my sleep habits.
