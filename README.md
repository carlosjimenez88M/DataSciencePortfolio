# Data Science Portfolio

In this repository you can find a collection of selected data science projects (and products) that I developed throughout my career.

## Contents 

- ### Statistical Modelling
  - [Multicollinearity effects](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1LaqJp4OpYnAq19ZRFHcx79N-kb2huuN-#scrollTo=nw2QpPpEoGa7): Experimental Designs to validate a real, reliable effect into variables to define model.

- ### Machine Learning
  - [Predict board game ratings](https://github.com/carlosjimenez88M/DataSciencePortfolio/tree/master/Machine_Learning):A model to predict the value of a given board game using various statistical analysis tools. Identified the best method to predict ratings. 

  - [Fine tuning and optimization in Xgboost Regressor](https://github.com/carlosjimenez88M/DataSciencePortfolio/blob/master/Machine_Learning/statistical_modeling_to_machine_learning/ARBNB-PRICES.md): Statistics applications to fineTuning Price predictions in case AirBnB.
  - [Competition models to regression problem with anomalies detection approach](https://github.com/carlosjimenez88M/DataSciencePortfolio/blob/master/Machine_Learning/lender_model/prediction_model.md): Approach to solving a regression problem with xgboost interpretability

  - [Classification models competition](https://github.com/carlosjimenez88M/DataSciencePortfolio/blob/master/Machine_Learning/classification/model_classification.ipynb) : Classifications models competitions to find the best performance and feature importance!

 

- ### Natural Lenguaje Processing
  - [Question Answering, NER and Text Classification](https://danieljimenez.shinyapps.io/hola_g/): Three with fine tune models, integrated with Shiny to generate a exploratory analysis with the prospect of gaining deep understanding in latam policys makers.
  - [Fine Tuning optimization on Question-Answering Models](https://github.com/carlosjimenez88M/DataSciencePortfolio/blob/master/NLP/OptimizationQA.ipynb): Using Hugging Face Transformers,based on the stories from the CoQA dataset to fine-tuned BERT model.



- ### Deep Learning 
  

  -[Image Recognition movie character and comics to Figure collection classification](https://github.com/carlosjimenez88M/batman_peacemaker_recognition): With help of image processing algoritms and deep learning techniques I try compute images of Figure collections, looking at movie characters and comics images (inputs).
